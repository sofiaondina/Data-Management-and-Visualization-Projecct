# ABSTRACT
128 years have passed since the Lumi√®re brothers invented the camera: an invention that revolutionizes
our way of life still today. On May 16, 1929, the Academy Award was awarded for the first time,
best known as an Oscar winner. From that moment on, the panorama of film awards widened:
film festivals are today highly prestigious events that carry out a fundamental work
of enhancement and promotion of authors, currents and trends of contemporary cinema.
The project aims to create a database containing information regarding films, TV series and
some of the most important awards awarded in these fields such as the Oscars, the Golden Globes and the Emmys.
Specifically, the goal is to investigate the connections between the title and the winning actors and the concordance between
the opinion of critics and the opinion of users.
